A brief of Project 2:
The website consists of three parts: Header, Main and footer.
The header consists of a logo and navigation, which will always be at the top of the page; The navigation adapts to the use of different devices, users can judge the current page through navigation.
The main part includes the title image and two wrappers; The title image is at the top and will only be displayed on the desktop view; The two wrappers use different layout and typesetting.
The footer has a signature and a button to back to the top.

I refer to some brands and make a simple logo, which will play a role in the mobile screen.
I planned to add other functions in project 1. I did try, however I chose to cancel this idea because it was useless.
I planned to use half of the page as the title page, however I chose the scheme on reference canvas and put it at the top, because it helps me to set up and use the top function.
Hovering over an image, its copyright will be displayed.
I used the media query to create a responsive html files. Did with desktop first, and classified 4 types: Desktop(one for large monitor, one for small monitor); Tablet and Mobile.
The header is always at the top of the page. When the reading is finished, clicking the icon on footer will send the view to top.
If this file run in mobile, the navigation will be hidden and will only be displayed by clicking the logo.
